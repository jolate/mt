We showed that the impact of sharing caches is very significant.

It is not clear whether sharing the clause database in the way we have
proposed has a significant effect on running time of the solver. On
the one hand, it should be clear that physically sharing data (in
general) should be beneficial for parallel programs (if for no other
reason, just to save space). However, to implement solvers that
physically share the clause database is non-trivial, and prone to
increasing complexity and running time. Interestingly, the problems
are not related, as is usual with these kinds of systems, to for
instance synchronization among the threads, but rather the problems
stem from the BCP mechanism. This is so because each thread must keep
track of its own watches (which, as far as is known, cannot be
shared).

Our results are a mixed blessing.


Future work is to continue with the development of  azudici,
incorporating in it further enhancements like formula preprocessing,
variable elimination, etc, etc, etc.
