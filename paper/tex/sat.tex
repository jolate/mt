% As mentioned before, some parallel SAT solvers have performed at the
% top of the last SAT competitions, but even though they all fall into
% the parallel solvers category, their parallel strategies and
% implementations vastly differ from each other. We mainly classify
% parallel SAT solvers into two categories: Portfolio approach solvers
% and divide-and-conquer solvers.

% The main idea behind portfolio approach solvers is the fact that
% different kinds of sequential solvers will perform differently for
% different kinds of SAT problems. The most successful sequential
% solvers [?] all have random factors coming into play when solving
% SAT problems. They need random numbers for their search heuristics
% [?] and thus the same solver might perform very differently in two
% different instances of the exact same SAT problem. Taking this into
% consideration, the portfolio approach is a very straight forward
% strategy: They run a group of sequential solvers in parallel, each
% with different random values and/or different search strategies. The
% time they take to solve the problem will be the time of the fastest
% solver in the group of solvers running in parallel. Although all
% portfolio approach solvers share this same principle, they also have
% quite different kinds of implementations. We identify in this group
% the solvers that are pure portfolio approach, the ones that share
% clauses only logically, and the ones that share clauses physically
% and logically.

%Solvers which are pure portfolio approach have the most simple
% design. They run completely independent solvers in parallel and wait
% for one of them to give an answer. Despite their simplicity, the
% solver ppfolio [?], a pure portfolio approach solver, was the winner
% of the crafted and random categories, and second place in the
% application category of the 2011 SAT competition of parallel
% solvers.

%On the other hand, we have more elaborated portfolio approach
% solvers, which can also share clauses logically between their
% different solvers [?]. One of the advantages of CDCL solvers is the
% fact that they can learn new lemmas as they solve a SAT problem
% [?]. These new lemmas will provide additional information during the
% solution search, so that the solver doesn't fall into previous
% fruitless search paths (there are also some drawbacks to adding new
% lemmas, which are addresses by clause database cleanups [?]). The
% idea is that different solvers running in parallel can share their
% learned lemmas so that they all benefit from what other solvers have
% learned and improve their own search. An example of these kind of
% solvers is ManySAT [?], which won the 2009 SAT competition in the
% parallel solver application category. ManySAT has its own sequential
% state-of-the-art SAT solver and runs different instances of it in
% parallel, using different VSIDS heuristics [?] and restart policies
% [?] for each of it, both of which account for random factors in the
% solver. The difference with pure portfolio approach solvers, is that
% ManySAT also shares learned lemmas between solving threads. It is
% called logical sharing of clauses, because the lemmas are passed as
% messages between threads and they never share the same physical
% information in memory. The advantage of logical sharing is that it
% is easier to implement message passing between threads, than having
% threads reading and modifying the same memory locations, which often
% requires locks that could end hindering the overall solver
% performance. [TALK ABOUT PLINGELING].

% Portfolio approach solvers that share clauses physically have the
% same strategy as mentioned before, but they share clauses by
% allowing threads to access the same memory locations, instead of
% message passing. One solver in this category is SarTagnan [?], which
% shares clauses logically and physically. [EXPLAIN MORE ABOUT
% SARTAGNAN].

% Divide-and-conquer solvers do not try to run different solvers in
% parallel, they run one solving instance, but try to parallelize the
% search and divide it between the different threads. A common
% strategy to divide the search space is to use guiding paths [?]. A
% guiding path is a partial assignment $M$ in $F$, which restricts the
% search space of the SAT problem. A solver that divides its search
% space with guiding paths will assign threads to solve $F$ with the
% given $M$ from the guiding path the thread was assigned with. Once a
% thread finishes searching a guiding path with no success, it can
% request another to keep searching. MiraXT [?] is a
% divide-and-conquer SAT solver which uses guiding paths. Moreover,
% different threads solving different guiding paths also share a
% common clause database, in which they store their learned
% lemmas. This is another example of physical clause sharing. [TALK
