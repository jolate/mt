The relevance of cache efficient algorithms in CDCL 
SAT-solvers performance is already known since 1993's 
Zhang and Malik paper \cite{ZhangMalik2003SAT}. In this
work we intend to update and measure such influence
in portfolio-approach-based parallel CDCL SAT-solvers.
The design of AzuDICI shared-all version is pretty much 
the same as in the (pa)MiraXT solver \cite{paMiraXT}.
Although we differ in the reasons of why portfolio-approach-based
parallel CDCL SAT-solvers do not scale, an indepth survey 
of parallel CDCL SAT-solving can be found in \cite{survey-psolvers}
